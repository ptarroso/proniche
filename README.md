# PRresence Only NICHE modelling

- Functions for several presence only niches models (bioclim, convexhull, kernel, domain, mahalanobis, normal distribution) adapted to multivariate
- Some example data
- Some coded examples

# TODO
- ~~Add multivariate normal distribution~~
- ~~Maybe add resampling to Mahalanobis (needs to estimate covariance)~~
- Create an R package
- Add documentation and references to original model publications
- Maybe some accessory functions to clean data set? (Remove duplicates, NAs, etc)
- ~~Instead of receiving coordinates as input, perhaps modelling functions should get already the environmental values at presences?~~ 
- function to plot models representation in environmental space?
