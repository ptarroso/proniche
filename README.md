# PRresence Only NICHE modelling

- Functions for several presence only niches models (bioclim, convexhull, kernel, domain, mahalanobis) adapted to multivariate
- Some example data
- Some coded examples

# TODO
- Add multivariate normal distribution
- Maybe add resampling to Mahalanobis (needs to estimate covariance)
- Create an R package
- Add documentation and references to original model publications
